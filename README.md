We have several tourist/visitors struggling a lot by browsing many different websites
for gathering information about the restaurants, transport, entertainment, places, events etc.,
when they visit a new place/city. They have to make note of all the information they like and
sort they out manually to plan a tour schedule. All these takes a lot of time, so avoid this and
make users tour a memorable part of their life, we came up with an idea of developing an
application. This application is a one stop platform for the users, where we integrate
information from different web services APIs and provide them to users in a customized and
user friendly interface based on the search criteria. Also users can short list their preferences
and make a tour schedule using the application.
Our main objective is to integrate all the useful web services that provide information
about restaurants, entertainment, transport, events and places on to a single platform. This
application also allows user to prepare a schedule of the day visits by combining all the
information in the userâ€™s schedule page. This app avoids users from browsing different
websites and wasting time in gathering information and making a pen-paper schedule. Based
on user information and history of visits we make the search pattern more user friendly.
